# discord-bot
A sample bot to receive news about the bitcoin cryptocurrency.

To bootstrap the bot, you need to create the token file with your Discord Dev credential.
To set up this:
* At the root, create a file: "token.js";
* Just set your token inside it, then export the variable:
```
const token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE";

module.exports = token;
```
* Finally, runs at terminal:
```
node index
```
You'll see the output below:
```
Bot is listening...
```
